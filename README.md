# Maze Solver Robot Application

Welcome to the Maze Solver Robot Application! This project is a Python application designed to solve mazes using a variant of the A* algorithm. Additionally, it provides a maze creation algorithm for generating custom mazes.

## Features

- **Maze Solver**: Utilizes a variant of the A* algorithm to find the shortest path through a maze from the start to the end point.
- **Maze Creator**: Generates custom mazes for testing or entertainment purposes.
- **Python GTK**: Developed with Python GTK for a user-friendly graphical interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- GTK+3 (Python bindings: PyGObject)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/StrayRaider/maze-solver-robot.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. sellect problem 2, have fun..

## Algorithms

### A* Algorithm

The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm known for its efficiency and optimality. Our variant of the A* algorithm is tailored to maze solving scenarios, taking into account maze topology to find the shortest path from start to finish.

### Maze Creator Algorithm

The maze creation algorithm generates mazes of varying complexities. It employs a randomized approach to carve out pathways and walls, ensuring each generated maze is unique.
